            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">1. General Rules for Japanese Ticketing</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">The Japanese ticketing system is heavily biased toward domestic residents. **The biggest wall is verification:** most platforms require a Japanese phone number, a Japanese address for physical ticket delivery, and often reject foreign credit cards.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2 font-semibold text-red-600">❌ **Warning:** Do NOT attempt to use fake credentials, as many venues now check IDs and you risk being denied entry.</p>

        <div id="lottery-system">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">2. Understanding the Ticket Lottery System (抽選)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">The primary method for securing tickets is the **lottery (抽選)** system, often starting with Fan Club pre-sales. **This is your best chance.** If you are eligible, strictly adhere to the following:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700 mt-2">
                <li>**Fan Club Advantage:** Always aim for the Fan Club lottery, as it offers the highest probability of winning.</li>
                <li>**Strict Rules:** Multiple lottery entries, duplicate accounts, or reselling tickets for profit are strictly forbidden and can lead to immediate account bans.</li>
                <li>**Payment Timing:** Payment is usually required immediately after winning the lottery.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div id="resale-platforms">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">3. Using Official and Trusted Resale Platforms (リセール)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">If you miss the initial lottery, **official resale platforms** are the safest route. These sites guarantee ticket authenticity and transfer rights, preventing scams.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700 mt-2">
                <li>**Trusted Sites:** Look for platforms officially partnered with the artist or venue (e.g., **チケプラリセール (Tixplus)**).</li>
                <li>**Non-Official Risk:** **NEVER** buy tickets from unofficial third-party resellers, social media, or auction sites. These tickets are often fraudulent or tied to the original owner and will result in denied entry.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div id="recommended-agencies">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">4. Recommended Agencies for International Fans</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">For international fans facing language and payment barriers, utilizing a **trusted Japanese ticket agency/proxy service** is the most reliable workaround.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">These services handle the domestic application process (Japanese number, Japanese payment) on your behalf, significantly increasing your chances of successfully acquiring a ticket without violating rules. Be sure to use services with high transparency and positive reviews from other international visitors.</p>
